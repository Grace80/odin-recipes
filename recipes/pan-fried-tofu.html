                (drained from its packaging liquid) onto the plate. Place two more
                papel towels on top of the tofu then put a heavy item on top. Not too 
                heave that it would completely crus the tofu but heavy enough that it
                can squeeze out liquid.
                Leave for 30 minutes and halfway through, change out the paper towels.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>Once the tofu has drained, slice in half then into cubes and place 
                into a large bowl. Sprinkle cornstarch on top and gently toss with your
